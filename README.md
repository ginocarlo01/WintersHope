## ✔️ Overview   

This game is top down adventure designed to be played on PC.

I am doing this game to be exposed at Gamescom, therefore it is completely original

The main feature is to hold the projectiles with your cursor and attack other enemies or obstacles with it.

## 🛠 Tools
The only tools used for this project were Unity and Visual Studio for coding. I utilized pre-existing assets for game development.

If you'd like to review the primary code I've created for this game, you can find it in Assets/Scripts.
